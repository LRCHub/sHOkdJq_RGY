I know you can't be,
You can't understand me,
I know you hope to do so,
And now you feel another love bone.

It sounds pretty to me,
I can't hold you,
To my hell and I sent you,
Oh I sent you to this hole,
I never forced you to rent my soul.

It's kinda pretty love,
Oh then I'm so hopeless,
So hopeless,
Can't I get none,
Can't get no answer,
Today baby.

She said,
I got a crush for the freaky one,
And nothing feels better than Machinegun Gogo,
She is the only one,
She loves the Machinegun Gogo

Can't feel none,
Too Hopeless,
To hope is hopeless,
Can't have my answers,
Two answers for my precious one,
How much I fear,
How could I answer that I'll never read your thoughts again?
But you just never know,
I just might go,
They say life is ending,
Well that is just perfect.

I got a crush for the freaky one,
And nothing feels better than Machinegun Gogo,
She is the only one,
She loves the Machinegun Gogo 2x

I cannot feel it gotta end this journey,
I had it all,
Now I feel I understand you,
Thank you.
Well that is so perfect!

I got a crush for the freaky one,
And nothing feels better than Machinegun Gogo,
She is the only one,
She loves the Machinegun Gogo.
